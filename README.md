### Tips for your Portfolio Repo:
* **Update Social Links:** Make sure to replace the `https://shivatej2503.github.io/portfolio-shivatej/` placeholders in the "Connect with Me" section with your actual profile URLs.
* **Add a Social Preview:** In your GitHub repository settings, upload a screenshot of your portfolio as the "Social Preview" image. This makes the link look professional when you share it on LinkedIn or Twitter.
* **Keep Projects Updated:** Every time you finish a new project (like the Currency Converter or Birthday Message app), remember to add a card for it in your portfolio!
